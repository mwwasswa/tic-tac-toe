## General Assembly SEI Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe

## Planning story

For my tic-tac-toe project, the goal was build out a fully functional board game that could be played online, have it interact with a backend to send and receive information to and from the player, with messages like “player turn X” when the turns switched or “game history record” when a player wants to see number of games that have played, and store game information like which spaces on the game board are taken and so forth.

#### Breaking down the challenge
I started by dividing my days into the tasks I had to accomplish, the easier ones came first and the more challenging things moved to back of the line. With that in mind, I began day one with working on a game board design for the wireframe because I wanted to have an idea of what I thought the finished application would look like on the user’s end, then moved on to the authorization sheets that encompassed the sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change password features which give provide game access to returning game users or prevent new users from playing the game until they signed up. Day two started with working on connecting the building out the game logic to find out if there was a “win” or “tie” in the game and connecting everything to the API. Then finally, day three was dedicated to fixing any left over bugs and removing any testing messages I had either in the game or in the console.

#### Wins, frustrations, what I could done differently

Going into the project, I inevitably fell down the rabbit hole when I decided to spend so much time on the wireframe, which led me into unnecessarily trying to recreate how we play the game and losing time in the process. The most frustrating part of the project was working my way through the logic so that it made sense to me before I could put into code. That said, the most rewarding part of the project was being able to click on the board and seeing the Xs and Os appear in the boxes. Even though everything wasn’t completely done, I knew that I had the basic functionality if the game working.
